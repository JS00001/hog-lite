# Security Policy

## Last Updated: February 25, 2025

We take security seriously and strive to ensure that our mobile app is safe for all users. This Security Policy outlines the measures we take to protect your data and maintain the integrity of our application.

## 1. Data Protection

- The app does not operate a backend server; all data is sent directly to PostHog.
- Your PostHog API key is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to third parties beyond PostHog.
- We do not collect personally identifiable information beyond what is necessary for analytics.

## 2. Secure Data Transmission

- All communication with PostHog is conducted over HTTPS to ensure data encryption during transit.
- We adhere to best practices to mitigate risks associated with data interception.

## 3. Application Security Measures

- Regular security updates are applied to address vulnerabilities.
- We follow secure coding practices to prevent common security threats such as injection attacks and data leaks.

## 4. User Responsibilities

To help maintain security, we recommend users:

- Keep their PostHog API key secure and not share it with unauthorized parties.
- Use devices with updated operating systems and security patches.

## 5. Reporting Security Issues

If you discover any security vulnerabilities or have concerns, please contact me at senyitkojack@gmail.com. I appreciate responsible disclosure and will address issues promptly.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Security Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected with a new "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the app after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
