# Privacy Policy

## Last Updated: February 25, 2025

Thank you for using our mobile app. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your data.

## 1. Data Collection

We do not operate a backend server and do not store any user data on our own infrastructure. However, we collect and send analytics data to PostHog directly from the client application. The data collected includes:

- App usage statistics (e.g., feature interactions, session duration, errors, etc.)
- Device information (e.g., OS version, device model)
- User-provided PostHog API key (stored locally on the device and used for authentication with PostHog)

## 2. Data Usage

The collected analytics data is used solely for the purpose of improving the app’s functionality and user experience. We do not sell, share, or otherwise distribute your data to third parties beyond PostHog.

## 3. Third-Party Services

Our app interacts directly with the PostHog API. Please refer to [PostHog’s Privacy Policy](https://posthog.com/privacy) for more details on how they process and store data.

## 4. Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your information. Your PostHog API key is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to any external servers other than PostHog. However, as with any online service, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 5. User Choices & Control

- You can manage your PostHog API key within the app.
- If you wish to stop analytics collection, you may remove your PostHog API key or stop using the app.
- You can refer to PostHog’s documentation on data deletion requests if needed.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected with a new “Last Updated” date. Continued use of the app after any updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
